## history of java 
java was introduced in the year of 1991 by james gosling.
He along with his team was working in the company names sun-microsystem. He faced some issue like 
security
platform architecture etc.
** currently oracle is the owner of java.
** Java was developed mainly to build internet best/based application.
** java has two parent
1. C - from c it has taken syntax excluding pointers.
2.  C++ - from c++ OOPS concept.

## Programming language
- programming language is used to interact with the machine,
- A language which is used to write the program is called a programming language
- Based on human understanding it is classified in three types:
1. High level language : A language which is completely understandable by human but not by machine is called 
  high level language  - java , c++ , c , python.
2. Mid?Intermediate level : A language which neither completely understandable by human nor by machine 
  is called as mid level language - Bytecode
3. Low level/Binary/Machine level language : A language which is not understandable by human 
   but completely understandable by machine 
  ex: 0's and 1's


## compiler 
   - It a software Which is used to convert high level language into low level language.

## Features of java
1. It is simple as compare to c+
2. It is platform Independent
3. It is secure
4. It has high performance
5. It is an efficient language
6. It supports OPPS
7. It supports multithreading(Multitasking)
8. It is portable
9. It is Robust (Widely Used)
10. It has a large community support
11. It is strictly typed language 
12. It is case-sensitive
13. It is architectural neutral language
14. It is secure
15. Highly performance
16. Good memory management because of garbage collector

## Ques : Why java is platform independent language ?

## sourceCode ----> Compiler(JavaC)---->ByteCode(platformIndependent) -----> JVM(pleteformDependent) ----> 1.Windows 2.Mac 3.Linux 

1. java is a two-step compilation based language it means compiler and interpreter both will work.
2. First compiler will work and convert java source code into ByteCode(mid level code).
3. After that JVM will take this bytecode as an input and convert it into the machine code.
4. It means it doesn't matter from which platform we are getting the byteCode we will get the same output on all the plateform.
5. This is the reason  java is platform independent language.

## Why java is secure ?
1. Because it does not support pointer that is  why we cannot get actual location of memory . so we cannot get the access the actual 
   address of a memory variable.
2. jvm is responsible to convert bytecode into machine code
3. Before executing the bytecode it will check 
 - whether the bytecode is generated by the valid compiler or not
 - whether the bytecode is properly structured or not
 - if it finds any problem it stops executing the bytecode.

## Why java is high performance ?
 - JVM executes the bytecode line by line 
 - suppose we invoke a function multiple times then - inside jvm we have a component known as JIT compiler will
   directly execute the bytecode into machine code.

## Java source file
- A file which contains instructions of java language is known as java source file.
- its extention will be .java

  ______________
## JDK - Java Development Kit 
- It contains all the necessary tools to develop a java program
-  Hierarchy of JDK
- JDK -----> JRE ------> JVM 
- JRE (JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT)
  1. It provides a run time environment to execute a java program

- JVM 
  1. JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE 
  2. It is an interpreter which is resposible for execute a java program 

- 3 steps to execute a java program
  1. Create a source file - create source file by using normal text editor notepad , 
  2. We can also use advance code editor vsCode , eclipse , intelligIdea.
  3. To create a source file we just need to create a file by any one the editor and save it by .java extention.
  4. Compile the source file - we need to compile the source file after the successfuly compilation ,
     compiler will generate bytecode file with name .class file 
  5. During the compilation the compiler will check rules and regulation (Syntax and semantics ).
  6. If compiler finds any mistake or error the compiler will throw an error and compiler will not generate .class
     file
  7. Syntax for the compilation
     1. javac source-fileName.java
     2. Ex : javac name.java
  8. Execution the .class file - In this stage we need to give .class file as an input to the
     JVM will execute this and give us output.
  9. syntax for the execution:-
     1. java className
     2. javaSourceFile -----> compilation ---> .classFile ------> JVM -----> output

## # Basic structure of java program.
- First we need to create a file and save it with .java extension
  inside the file we can write our java instruction
- Inside a file we can create a class
  1. class - it is a predefined word 
  2. It must be written in the lowercase 
  3. It is used to create a class block
  4. class Demo {  Class-Block }
  5. file name and class name can be different ... It is not necessary to have same name class and file  
  6. Inside the class we can have the following components
     1. method
     2. variable
     3. constructor 
     4. static Initializer
     5. non static Initializer
     6. class

## Tokens 
   1. This is the smallest component of any programming language which helps to write a program.
   2. In , java we have follow tokens.
      - keyword
      - identifier 
      - literals
      - separator
      - comments
      - operators
      
   3. Keyword
      - it is a predefined word 
      - it has special meaning / own meaning all the keyword written in the lowercase.
      - In , java we have 50+ keyword ---> Exactly 53
      
   4. Identifiers
      - It is the name given to recognize class in java
      - we cannot give any name we have to follow sum rules.
      - Rules of identifiers
        1. Cannot be started with number.
        2. Only '$' and '_' are used as a special character apart from these no special character can be used in an identifier.
        3. Spaces is not allowed in an identifier .
        4. Keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
   
      - Conventions
        1. it is not a rule of an identifier it is just an industrial standard, which we should follow while 
           giving to the identifiers.
        2. Class Convention.
           1. class should be written in upper Camel-case.
           2. Every word first letter should be written in UpperCase
           3. convention for interface is the same.
        3. Method Convention 
           1. lower camel case.
           2. it means if it contains only one word it should be written 
              in the lowercase  , but if it contains multiple word from the second word onwards first word of each letter
              should be written in smallCase.
           3. Same convention for variables is followed.
      
   5. Literals
       1. it is a data pass by a programmer in a program.
       2. In java there have 4 types of literals
          1. Number ---> Types ----> Integer , Floating point
          2. Character 
          3. Boolean 
          4. String
          5. Number Literals:
             1. it can be of two types 
             2. 1. Integer 2. floating point
          6. Character Literals
             1. Anything which is enclosed within single quote and its length is exactly 1 is known as 
                character literals.
          7. Boolean Literals 
             1. it represents a logical data or a condition.
             2. it has two types 1. true 2. false
             3. true and false is a keyword 
          8. String literals 
             1. Anything which is passed within double quote is known as String literals
          9. separators 
             1. it is used to separate one component to another.
             2. , , ; , { } , : , () , . , 
          
          10. Comments
              1. its is the non-executable code which is used to increase the readabilty of the code.
              2. Types - Single Line , Multiline Comment
              3. Example : // This code is not readable as it is a comment and not going to execute.
              4. Example: /* 
                 This is a 
                 multi line comment
                */
          
          11. Operators
          

## Display Statement

 1. The statement which is used to print a message on the console . In java we have two types of display statement.
     i. System.out.println();
     ii.System.out.print();
     iii. System.out.printf();
2. System.out.println() : it is used to print a message on console. After that cursor will go on next line.
    1. example : System.out.println("hello");
       console is nothing just a collection of grid.
    2. it can be used without passing any data.
3. System.out.print()
   1. it is used to print the message on console after printing the cursor will go to the next position.
   2. it cannot be used without any data.


## variable
 1. It is a block of memory(Container) which is used to store a data.
 2. Every variable has some name so we can also call it as named block of memory.
    3. Declaration of memory....
       syntax : datatype identifier;
       Datatype: it specifies which type of data needs to be stored inside a block of memory.
    4. In java we have following datatype
       1. Primitive datatype
          1. It is a predefined datatype which is used to store primitive value/data
          2. In java we have follow  data type.
             1. byte ---> Integer--->1byte--->0
             2. short ----> Integer----> 2byte---->0
             3. long ----> Integer -----> 8byte---->0l/L
             4. int ----> Integer -----> 4byte----> 0
             5. float ----> float ----> 4byte ---- 0.0f
             6. char -----> character -----> 2byte ---> 'u\0000' 
             7. boolean ----> boolean ----> 1 bit ----> false;
             8. double -----> double -----> 8byte ----> 0.0
          3. Since these are predefined data type so it should be in the lowercase.
          4. after the decimal point if you want to store 5-6 no. you can use float but if you want to more decimal no 
              after point you can use double.
          
       2. Non-primitive data type
                           
      



## charateristics of variable
   1. it is temporary 
   2. it has a lifespan
   3. inside a variable you can add a single value , inside a variable you can store fetch and update a data.
   4. Initialize a variable
      byte b; declaration.
      b = 25; initialize.
            or
      byte b = 34;
## how declare multiple variable of same datatype.
   1. syntax: 
      - Datatypes identifier1 , identifier2 , identifier3 ....... identifier-n;
      - ex : int a ;
      - int b;
      - int c;
      int a , b , c;
      - byte n1;
      - double n2; 
      - float n3;
        byte n1 , double n2 , float n3; X XXX  not allowed error;
      - syntax :
          datatype identifier1 = value , identifier2 = value, identifier3 = value
   ## types of variable.
   1. Based on datatype
      - primitive variable
      - Non-primitive variable
   2. based on scope
      - Global variable i. static ii. non-static
      - Local variable
   # primitive datatype : 
   - A variable which is used to store primitive variable. primitive variable has fixed size.
   - ex : int a = 2 , byte b = 23 , float f = 2.6 ,  double a = 123.56845 

   # Non-primitive variable 
   - it is used to store multi-value data
   - it is a user defined - it is created with the help of non-primitive data type.
   - Ex : Array , String , Object - syntax -> String s = null;

   # Based on scope: 
   - Global scope
   - Local Scope
   - Here scope means visibility of the variable
   - Local variable
     - A variable which is declared inside the method block or any other specific block.
     - class demo{
     - public static void main(String[] args){
     - char a = 'e'; //local variable
     - }
     - }
     - Rules of local variable:
     - we cannot use it outside the block because local variable is visible only within 
       the block where it is declared.
     - We cannot use it without initialization.
     - We cannot have more than one local variable with the same name within the same block.
   
   # operators 
   - It is a predefined symbol which is used to perform specific task.
   - Operand : Operand is the data on which operator works.
   - ex 10 + 20 operand - 10 and 20 + is operator
   - combination of operator and operand ex: 10 + 20 , 1*2 + 5  6;
   - characteristics of operator
   - Every operator after performing a task will return a data or value.
   - Every operator has some precedence or priority.
   - every operator follows rules of associativity. it means direction of execution . It means when two or more operator having
     the same precedence either from left to right or right to left.
   - Associativity has always not the same 
   - Note : In an expression of we have multiple operator then first it is evaluated based on the precedence of operator
     but two or more operator having same precedence then we have to solve according to associativity.
   - Types of operator
   - Based on operand
     - Unary
     - Binary
     - Ternary
   - Based on task
     - Arithmetic
     - increment/Decrement
     - Relational
     - Assignment
       - compound assignment
     - Logical operator
     - conditional operator
     - Bitwise operator
   
   - Based on the operand operator is classified into three types.
     unary : an operator which takes only one operand to perform a task is called unary operator
     ex: increment , decrement and logical not operator.
   - Binary operator : An operator which takes only two operand to perform a task is called binary operator.
     ex : Arithmetic relational operator , Assignment and relational.
   - Ternary : An operator which takes exactly operand to perform a task is called ternary operator.
      ex : conditional operator .
   - Based on the task:
     - Arithmetic operator : it is a binary operator which is used to perform an arithmetic operation
       ex : Addition(+) , subtraction(-) , multiplication(*) , division(/) , modulus(%)
       - it is used to add two numeric value - Integer and decimal - In addition operator in any one of operand 
       - of string type then instead of addition it will perform concatenation.
     
   - Modulus operator : it is used to divide a number and return a number.

## increment decrement operator : 
 - it is a unary operator 
 - it is used to increase and decrease a value by one.
 - based on the position it is classified into two types.
 - Increment --> preIncrement , PostIncrement
 - Decrement ---> postDecrement , preDecrement;
 - PostIncrement
   - it is a unary operator which is used to increase a value by one
   - it is written after the variable --> int n = 2; n++;
   - it will first used the existing value of the variable after that it increases the value.
 -PreIncrement
   - it is also a unary operator
   - which is used to increase a value by one but in preIncrement increment symbol is used before tha variable.
   - int i = 10; ---> sopln(++i);
   - it will first increase the value of a variable by one then used the updated value..
   - Note : Increment and decrement operator cannot be used on a constant value , it can be applied on a variable
   
## Assignment operator
   - it is binary operator , it is used to assign the value to the variable.Associativity : right to left.
   - LHS mus be a variable.
   - it has the least precedence.
   - Note : if an expression contains multiple operators then it will be solved based on the operators precedence, but if 
     two or more operator having same precedence then associativity of the operator will be followed.

## Compound Assignment operator 
   Combination of arithmetic operator and assignment operator.
   n+=2 ; n = n+2

## logical operator
   - logical AND (&&)
   - logical OR(||)
     - It is binary operator
     - It is used to merge more than one condition AND if any of the condition returns true it will also return true.
     - In logical or operator if the first condition returns true it will directly return true.It will not even check 
       the second condition.
   - logical NOT(!)
   - It can be used only on the condition of boolean data, In java we have above logical operator
   - write a condition to check whether a given day is comes under weekend or not

- write A condition to check whether given month is february or not based on no of days
- int noOfDays = 28;
- if(noOfDays == 28 || noOfDays == 29)
- sout(True)
- Write a program to check whether a number is multiple of 5 or 6       
- logical or operator is used whenever we have multiple conditions & we have to satisfy anyone of them.
- conditions should return true.
- if all the conditions returns false then only logical ir operator returns false.


## logical AND OPERATOR (&&)
   - It is a binary operator 
   - It is used when we have to satisfy all the conditions
   - If any one of the condition return it directly return false , it will not check the further conditions.
   - Ques : Write a condition to check whether a given number is positive even number or not. 
   - It returns true when all the conditions is satisfied (true)
   - Write a conditions to check whether a given character is lowercase alphabet or not.
   - Write a program whether a given number is align within 100 or multiple of 5.
   - Write a java program to check whether a year is leap year or not.

## Logical Not
   - It is unary operator
   - It is used to negate a condition or reverse a given condition . its return type is always be boolean.
   - It can be used only on the condition or boolean literals.
   - ex: sout(!true)----> false.
         sout(!false)----> true.
## Ternary Operator || conditional operator
   - it is a ternary operator .
   - it is used to take a decision.
   - it acts as a decision making statement.
   - syntax : operand1 ? operand2 : operand3.
   - operand1---> true ---> operand2 is ans.
   - operand1---> false ---> operand3 is ans.
   - operand1 should be a condition

```
# working of ternary operator 
 - In operand1 we have to write a condition which evaluates to true and false.
 - In place of operand2 and operand3 , you can write any data , number , string, values.
 - The return type of conditionals / ternary operator depends upon the data type of operand2 and operand3.
 - Ques : write a java to find smallest of two number;

        int a = 23;
        int b = 12;
        a >= b ? System.out.println("a is greater") : System.out.println("b is greater");

 -  write a java program to check whether a given number is even or odd.
        
        int a = 5;
        a%2 == 0 ? System.out.println("even number") : System.out.println("odd number");
 - write a java program to check whether a given character is number or not.
       
       char ch = '10';
- when you want to take last digit of any number then we have to take its modulus by 10.

# TYPE CASTING
  - The process of converting one type of data into another type of  data is known as typecasting.
  - We have two types ---> primitive typecasting ----> Non-primitive.
      primitive ---> 1. widening 2. narrowing 
  -   Non-primitive ----> 1.upcasting 2. down-casting 
  - Primitive typecasting                
     - The process of converting one type of primitive data into another type primitive data is known as 
       primitive typecasting.
     - Widening : The process of converting smaller type of data into larger type of data is known as widening.
       - Ex : byte b = 10; int a = b;
       - float f = 3.6f;
         double d = f;
       - char ch = 'y';
         long l = ch;
       - it is done by the compiler implicitly because here there no chance of data loss.
       - byte < short < int < long < float < double -----> widening.
       - ASCII
       - It stands for 'american standard code for information interchange'. It means for every character 
          unique positive number is associative or linked with the character.
       - It will be up to 256 character.
     - Narrowing :
       - The process of converting larger type of data into smaller type of data .
       - In case of narrowing there is a chance of data loss , so we have to do typecasting externally.
     
     - Recycling process : The process converting the in the range of datatype:

# #if
  - It is a keyword
  - syntax
  -          if(conditions){
                //java statement///
             }
  - if condition is true then the block of code executed.
  - if condition is false then the block of  is skipped
  - simple if is used to take the decision when we want to execute or skip a set of instruction based on the conditions.
  - working process.
    - In the 'if' first controller will check the condition if the condition is returns true then it will go 
      inside the block and execute all the set of instruction.
    - Ques : write a program to check whether a given number is multiple of five or not if it is multiple then 
      print its square.
    - Ques : Write a program to print the number if it contains fraction value otherwise skip it.
    - Ques : Write a program to check whether a number 0 or not at the unit place ;
    
## if else:
   - Both if and else are keyword
   - syntax :

                if(conditions){

                    //Code java
                 }
                else{

                  //java code

                  }
   - if we have to take the decision whether one set statement will be executed or another set 
     of statement will be executed then we use if else statement.
   - # #working process
       1. First control will the check the if condition , if it returns true then if block will get executed but if it 
           returns false then else block will get executed.
       2. In if else any one block  will get executed , both the block are never get executed once.
       3. write a java program to check whether a character is alphabet or not.
       4.  write to java program check whether a number is even or odd .
       5. write a java program to check whether a given number multiple of 8 or not if it is multiple then check 
        it is also multiple of 3 and 6 both or not.
   # else if ladder.
   - it is used whenever we have more than two options and we have to select only one options.
   - syntax : 
        
          if(condition){
               java code      
          }
          else if(conditions){
                java code       
   
           }
          else if(conditions){
                java code

           }
    
          else if(conditions){
                 java code

           }
         .
         .
         .
         else{
          
           java code..

         }
   - In else if ladder first control will check the if condition , if the condition is satisfied then it will go 
     inside the if block and executes all the statement , but if it returns false then it will check the next else if
     condition , if any else if condition returns true then that corresponding block will get executed & it will
     not check any else if condition further , but if all the else if condition returns false then it will execute else block.
   -  In else if ladder else block is not mandatory , it is optional.
   - Ques : Write a program to determine student grades based on the obtained marks.
   - Ques : write a java program to check whether a given character is , number , alphabet or special character.
   - Ques: Write a java program to find smallest of three number;

# switch conditional keyword
 - it is a keyword
 - syntax:
   
       switch(value/exp)
       {
         case val/exp : //java ststement
         case val/exp: //java statement
         case val/exp: //java statement
         .
         .
         .
         .
         default : //java statement
        }

 - inside switch we can pass byte , short , int , char and string typeof value, but we cannot pass float , double , long
   and boolean type of value
 - int the case we have to pass constant value , it means we cannot pass a variable also.
 - # working process of switch:
 - switch uses predefined equality operator which compares value of switch with the value of case, if any case value
   is getting matched with the switch value then that particular case block along with all the remaining below
    case block will also gets executed without checking the case value.
 - if no case value is matching with the switch value then default block will get executed.



# 22-05-2025 Methods In Java
- It is a block of code or set instructions which is used to perform a specific task.
- if we want to perform a specific task  in our requirement then instead of writing a the related code in every
  requirement , we will write irt ones and reuse it every requirement.
- advantages of methods
  - It enhances code reusability.
  - It also increases code readability.
- characteristics of methods.
  - Method will get executed whenever it is called.
  - we can have n number of method inside a class.
  - we can use/call the methods n numbers of time.
  - Method are executed in stack area , called stack frame.
- Syntax to create a methods.
    
      [Modifiers] return-type methodName([formal argument])
       {
           
          //code.
      
        }
        public static void main(String []args){
        }
- Method terminology
  1. method signature -> method name + formal Argument is termed as method signature.
  2. main(String[] args)
  3. Method Declaration -> Modifier , return type along with method signature
  4. public static void main(String []args)
  5. Methods definition
  6. Method declaration + Method body
  7. public static void main(String []args)
     {

     }
- Modifiers...
  - It is used to change or modified the behaviour of component of java.
  - In Java we have two types of modifiers
    1. Access Modifiers ---> public , private , protected , default...
    2. Non-Access Modifiers ,---> static , volatile , abstract , final , native , synchronized. 
- Return type - when a method is called it will perform a task and return a data to thr caller.
  return type specifies which type of data is given back to the caller.
  1. void -> does not return anything.
  2. primitive type
  3. non-primitive.

# Types of method
 
                        ** types of methods

    1. Based on argument                   2. Based on modifiers
       1. no argument method                   1. static method
       2. parameterised method                 2. Final method
       3. var arg Method                       3. abstaract method
                                               4. native method
                                               5. synchronised method.
1. Based on argument.
   1. No - argument method : A method which does not take any formal argument is known 
      as No argument method . A variable which is declared inside the method parenthesis 
      is known as formal argument.
     

       public static void first(){

       }

   2. Calling a no argument methods : syntax --> first();
   3. create a ametyhid to print first 10 natural number in rebverse order
   4. write a java program to calculate square of a number.
   5. write a program to print all the factors of a given number.

# * what happens when a method is called.
  - whenever we execute our java program JVM will first call the main method for the execution of 
    this method a frame will br created in the stack area.When it encounters any method call statement
    control will transfer from the caller to the called method and execution of the caller will be paused.
  - Execution of call method will start from the beginning.After completion of the execution control
    will go back to the caller & execution of caller will be resumed.

# * Drawbacks of no argument methods...
- In no argument method does not accept any formal argument , so every time we have to go inside the method and change the value
  it means we are not allowed to pass any data.
- to overcome this method we use parametrized method.

  1. Parameterised method : 
  - A method which accept formal argument is known as parameterised method.
  - actual argument : It is a data which we pass to call a method.
  - rules to call a parameterised method
    1. To call a parameterised method , no of formal argument and no of actual agguent mjust be sAME
    2. type of formal argument and actual argument also should be same.
    3. if type of formal argument and actual argument is not same , then compiler will try to do widening , but if it is not 
       possible , then we will get CTE.
    4. syntax : modifier return-type identifier(Datatype identifier1 , Datatype identifier2 , ...... datatype identifier_n){
       }
    5. create a method to calculate a factorial of a given number...
    6. write a java program to print sum of three number...
    7. create a method which accepts character and print ascii value od the character...
    8. write a java program to check whether a given number is palindrome or not..
    9. write a program to print sum and product of range of two number...

# A method which returns data...
- In  java we can create a method which returns a data to the caller.
- A method which returns a data its returns type should be other than void.
- A Method can return primitive and non-primitive type of data...
-       syntax: [modifier] return type methodName([formal arguments]){
-        return value/exp;
-        }
- it  is a keyword.
- it is a control transfer statement which stops the execution of current method and transfer the control to the caller.
- it should be return at the last otherwise we get CTE.
- return  is used to transfer a data or value after the operation to the caller.
- with the help of return keyword we can return s single value...
- we can have only one return statement inside the method body...
- if return type of  method is void then writing return statement is optional , but if return type of  method is other than void 
  then writing return statement is compulsory otherwise it will give CTE.
- write a java program to return a sum of two integer number with the help of parametrised method.
- write a java program to calculate sum of square of two number..
- create a method which takes an alphabet and return the its corresponding uppercase and lowercase character in such a way that 
- if it takes uppercase it return lowercase and if lowercase then uppercase.
- write a java program to check whether a number is perfect cube or not.
- write a program to find the sum of digit of each number..
- write a program to check whether the given number is armstrong or not...
- A number which is equal to sum of each digit raise to the  power equal to count of digit...
- Write a java program to return sum of factorial of each digit in a given number..
- write a java program to check whether a given number is harshad number or not. A number which is divisible sum of its digit..
- LCM of two number && HCF of two number. lcm * hcf = ProductOfTwoNumber.

# var arg methods...
- A method which can take variable number of argument is known as var args method.
- It was introduced in jdk 5.
- This ,method is capable of receiving multiple number of actual argument.
- syntax:
-                [modifiers] returntype method_name(Datatype... identifierName)
                   {
                     
                   }
                   public static void m1(int... a){
 
                    }

- if in a class we have two ,method with same name , and one method is variable argument method , if we call the method by
  by passing same type of actual data in this case highest priority given to the same type of method.
# Rules of var-args method
  - In var-args method variable type of method must be declared at the last.
               
              public static void m2(int x , int... k){}

  - In var-arg method we can have only one variable argument type of parameter.
     
            public static void m2(int... x){}

  - In var-arg method we can pass any number of data , it will store in the form of array. 

- write a java program to return sum of factors of a integer number...execluding the given number

# # OOPS (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING).
1. Object-Oriented Programing is a new style of programming in which we consider every real world entity in form of object.
2. Object : It is a real world entity which has its own properties and behaviours , functionality.
3. characteristic of an object.
   - An object has a name.
   - An object has a properties.
   - An object has a behaviors.
5. properties : It is defined in form of variable.
6. behaviour : It is described in the form of methods.
7. object oriented programing is used to develop real world scalable and dynamic applications.
8. It is a programing paradigm in which every is represented in the form of object.
9. It follows bottom-up approach. Object oriented programming provides a mechanism to create an object store the object and performs
   an operations on the object.
10. It also provides some principle.
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - polymorphism
    - Abstraction
    - These are the four pillars of OPPS
11. Fundamental of OPPS is class and object...
12. Ques : write down the difference between procedural oriented programming language and object-oriented programming language.
13. object is used to represent real world entity into software world or in other words it is a software world representation   
     of real world entity.
14. Note : since all the properties and behaviour  of a particular object we require a dedicated block of memory to replicate 
    real world entity init the real world but in java we don't have any primitive data type to store all these properties and 
    behaviour together, so we have to go for user defined non primitve datatype. We can create our own user defined non primitive data type 
    with the help of class.
15. Class : it is keyword.
    - it is compulsory for the execution of program.
    - it is used to create used defined non-primitive data type.
    - it is a blueprint of an object
    - In java we also have some predefined classes;
      - system , scanner , string , Stringbuilder etc.
    - Non-primitive data types
      - It is a user defined data type.
      - it is used to store the references or address 
      - In primitive data type we have fixed number of data type. fixed size
      - we can have n  number non-primitive datatype. not fixed size.
      - In java every class name will acts as a u user defined non-primitive data type.
      - class hello{} : Hello is non-primitive data type.
    - Non-primitive variable.
    - A variable which  used to store address or references of a block of memory or object is known as non-primitive variable.
    - In java we can have n number of non-primitive variable.
    - Inside a non-primitive variable we can store two things .
       1. Address and references.
       2. default value of non-primitive variable;
# members of class
  - any member which is declared in a class is called as member of clas
  - Inside a class we can have two types of member 
     1. static member 
     2. non-static member
  1. Static Member : A member which is declared inside a class which is prefix with static keyword is known as static  
     member.
     - In java we have following static member.
     - 1. static method
       2. static variable
       3. static initializers
     - Static Method : 
       - A method which is declared inside a class prefix with static keyword is known as static method.
       - It will  get its memory inside class static area that's why it is known as member of class.
       - A block which belongs to static member is known as static context.
       -    
       -            public static void print(){
                       static block 
                        }
       - we can access static method inside the static context same class directly.
       - we can access static method inside the static context of same class with the help of class name and access operator.
         1. Access operator : It is a binary operator.
         2. It is used to access the member which is present in the particular memory location.
         3. we can access method inside static context of different class with the help of class name and access operator.
       - Static variable : 
         1. A global variable which ius declared inside a class prefix with static keyword is known as static keyword.
         2. It will gets its memory inside class static area.
         3. Since all the static variable will gets its memory inside class static area, that's why it is known as class 
            static variable
         4. we can access static variable inside a static context of same class directly as well as with the help of class
            name and access operator.
         5. static variable wil be loaded inside a class static area with its default value.
         6. We can access static variable inside a static context of different class with the help of class name and access operator.
         7. We can have static variable and local variable with same name in this case highest priority will be given to local 
            variable, but of you want to access static variable we have to use class and access operator. 
         

  Ques :  Print differences of two consecutive prime number.
  Ques :  write a java program to check whether a given number is perfect number or not. A perfect number is a number 
          which factor of number sum is equal to its number itself;
  Ques :  write a java program to check whether a number is happy number or not.A  number is happy number if it reaches to one
          after getting the sum of sqaures of each digit


# static initializers.
 - It is used for the initializer purpose.
 -      class A {
        static int i = 10;  
       }


# static block
- An anonymous block which is prefixed with static keyword , is known as static block.
- It should be declared inside a class.
- It will be executed during class loading process.
- It will be executed only once.
- If we have multiple static block it will be executed from top to bottom order.

# characteristic of static method
- No name 
- No return typw.
- As a programmer we cannot call it , it will be executed directly during the class loading process.
- If we want to perform any task before the main method that should be return inside static block.

# class loading process
-  First we create a source file and after the successful compilation we will get .class file.
-  JVM will convert .class file into binary and it will start loading it into the memory area , this process
    is known as class loading process.
- In class loading process first entire code . binary information laded into the method area.
- If it contains any static method its reference will be copied into class static area.
- If we have any static variable , it wll be loaded into class static area with its default value.
- If we have static initializer it will be executed directly from top to bottom order.it completes class loading process.

 ques: write a java program to check whether a number is neon number.A neon number is a positive integer where sum of digit 
       of a square of a number is equal to number itself.

# Non-static member 
- Any member which is declared inside a Class without prefixed with static keyword id known as non-static method.
- In java we have following non-static member...
- NON STATIC METHOD
- NON STATIC VARIABLE
- NON STATIC INITIALIZERS
- CONSTRUCTOR
- IMPORTANT POINTS RELATED TO NON-STATIC MEMBER
- 1. ALL THE NON-STATIC MEMBER WILL BE ALLOCATED INSIDE AN OBJECT , SO WITHOUT OBJECT CREATION WE CANNOT ACCESS IT.
  2. ALL THE NON-STATIC MEMBER WILL BE LOADED INSIDE AN OBJECT EVERY TIME WE CREATE AN OBJECT , OBJECT WILL BE CREATED 
     INSIDE THE HEAP AREA.
  3. EVERY OBJECT WILL HAVE A BUILT-IN REFERENCE OR ADDRESS.
  4. IT(OBJECT) IS ALSO KNOWN AS INSTANCE OF CLASS.
  5. THE PROCESS OF OBJECT CREATION IS KNOWN AS INSTANTIATION.

# object 
- it is a block of memory inside a heap area during the run time.
- it follows dynamic memory allocation because it is created during run time.
- syntax to crete an object ...
- new classname()---> constructor.
# new
1. it is a keyword .
2. it is a unary operator.
3. it is used to create a block of memory inside the heap area during the run time.
4. new keyword is used to dynamic memory allocation.
5. The address of block  of memory which is created inside a heap area will be given in the following format
   fullyQualifiedClassName@Hexadecimalvalue.
6. This address will be return by new keyword.

# constructor...
  1. It is used to load all the non-static member inside the object.

# Non-primitive data type...

  1. It is user-defined data type which is used to store reference or address of an object.
  2. It does not have fixed number.
  3. In java every class will act as a user defined non-primitive data type.

# Non-primitive variable/reference variable..
  1. A variable which is used to store address and reference of an object is known as non-primitive variable.
     Example : System s1; String s = null; car c ; Apple A = new Apple();

# Non-static method
1. Any method which is declared inside a class without prefixed with static keyword is known as non-static method.
2. Non-static method will be loaded/allocation inside the object in heap area.
3. A block which belongs to non-static member is known as non-static context.
4. To access the non-static method inside the static context we need an object.
5. It means to access non-static method object is required.
6. we can access a non-static method inside non-static context of same class directly.
7. we can access a non-static method inside a static or non-static context of different class with the help of object reference.
8. we can access the static method with the help of object reference , we can also access static method inside a non-static context directly. 
9. we can call static method inside a non-static method... 



- Write a program to print gp series...
- To check whether given number is automorphic or not . a number is called automorphic number  whose sqaure ends with 
  the same digit itself.
- 


# Non-static block







# Advantages of non static block
 - Non-static block will get executed every we crete an object , so it can be used to count the number of object created.
 - we can use it to generate the unique id.

# this keyword
  - it is a keyword.
  - it is a non-static variable 
  - it contains the current object reference.
  - it can be used only inside the non-static context.
  - Note : if we have non-static variable and local variable with the same name in this cse highest priority given to the 
    local variable  , but if you want to access non-static variable inside a non-static context then we have to use this 
    keyword.

# constructor
  - it a special non-static member which is used to load and initialize a non-static member inside an object. 
  - it is used to create an object along with new operator.
  - in java every class must have at-least one constructor , so as a programmer if we forget to create a constructor then it will be added by the compiler which is also known as default constructor.
  - default constructor will be a no-argument constructor.
  - constructor name must be same as class name.
  -      synatx : [Access modifiers] className([formal argument]){



        }
  - constructor is same as method, but it does not have any return type.
  - it is by default a non-static member so constructor body will act as a non-static region/context.
  - types of constructor
    1. default constructor
    2. user-defined constructor ----> 1.Non-argument 2.parametrized constructor.
    
    
  Ques : write a program to create multiple instance of any object such as student or employee and generate password of the 
         student based on the student id...
  - create a class book define its states such as bookid , authorname , price and its behaviour such as read , edit , etc.
    create its 3 instance of book and initialize its states dynamically.
# user-defined constructor
  - As a programmer we can also define our own constructor that is knows and custom constructor.
  - It has two types 1. No-argument constructor 2.parameterised constructor...
  - A constructor which does not take any formal argument is known as no argument constructor...
  - Drawback : In no argument constructor we have to write extra statement to initialize the object states to overcome this 
  - problem we have to go for parameterised constructor...
  - Parameterised constructor : A constructor which takes formal argument is known as parametrised constructor...
  - It is used to initialize the object states while creating an object.
  - [Access modifier] class_name(data-type identifier1 , data-type identifier2 , ..... data-type identifier-n){}

# constructor overloading
  - If a class is having more than one constructor with the same name as class name but different formal argument is known 
    as constructor overloading.
  - Formal argument can vary based oin length , type , and order of declaration.

# when should we declared member as static and non-static 
  - If states of an object varies from object to object then we need to, load it when we crete an object 
    in this case it should be declared as non-static...
  - But if the states is same for all the object then no need to load it every time inside the object,all the object can
    share a single copy of it , then it should be declared as static...


        static member ----> static context               Non-static context
                   1. directly                             1.) directly
                   2, by using classname and .dot operator  2.) By using class nemae and access operator
                   3. by using object reference..            3.) by using this
       Non-static member.                                         
                   1.) with the help of object reference      1.) directly
                                                               2.) by using this

# constructor chaining   
  - The process of one constructor call another constructor is known as constructor chaining.
  - We can achieve constructor chaining within same class within the help of 'this()' call statement. 
  - constructor chaining is used to avoid duplicate code , for code reusability /code modularity.
  - 
# this() statement
  - It is used for the constructor chaining within same class.
  - It can be used only inside the constructor body.
  - It must be the first statement inside the constructor body.
  - We cannot have more than one this() statement inside a constructor body.
  - If we have n constructor then we can have maximum n-1 this call statement.
  - A constructor cannot call itself because recursive this() call statement is not allowed.

# Object loading process
 - The process of creating an object and loading all the non-static member inside the object is known as object loading process.
 - when we create an object .
   1. new will crete a block of memory inside the heap area and constructor of the class will be called implicitly 
     and object loading process starts.
   2. If any non-static variables are present it will be loaded inside the object with default value.
   3. If any non-static method are present it reference will be copied inside the object .
   4. If any non-static initializers are present they will get executed directly from top to bottom order.
   5. After that new will return the block of address of memory.

# Encapsulation...
  - Encapsulation is one of the principle of object oriented programming.
  - The process of binding/wrapping the states and behaviour of an object in a single unit  is known as encapsulation. 
  - In java we can achieve encapsulation with the help of class.
  - That class is known as encapsulated class.. 
  - Java BIN is a stongly encapsulated class...

# Advantages of Encapsulation


  - Data Hiding
  - We can achieve authentication , ----> verify the credential..
  - We can achieve authorization , ----> 
  - we can also achieve validation.

# Data Hiding
  - The process of restricting the direct access and providing the controlled 
    acess with the help of method of same class.

# steps to achieve data hiding...

  - Make the data member is private.
  - Provide the controlled access with the help of getter and setter method.
  - private : 
    1. It is keyword.
    2. it is an access modifier.
    3. Any member which is prefix with private access modifier can be   accessed directly only within the class. 
    4. private members are visible only within the class.
    5. To access or modify private member outside the class we required getter and setter methods.
  - Getter Method
    1. It is ued to get the private data outside the class.
    2. points related to getter method...
       - It is non-static .
       - It should be public.
       - Its return type should not be void.
       - It should be a no-argument method.
       - It should be prefix with get word.
       - Return type of getter methid depends on the data type of private field which we want to access.
       syntax : public privateMemberDatatype getPrivateMemberName(){
        return privateMemberName.
       }
  - Setter Method
    1. It is uused to modify the private data member outisde the class.
    2. Points related to setter method.
       - It should be public .
       - Its return type should be void.
       - It should be parametrised method.
       - It should be prefix with set .
       - It is non--static.
       - formal argument type of parametrised method depends on the data type of private member.
       - Syntax : public void setPrivateMemberName(privateMemberDatatype privateMemberName){
        this.privateMemberName = privateMemberName;
       }
       - public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
       }
    Note : with the help of encapsulation we can give/set the visiblilty of our private data.. 
    3. only readable ---> getter method
    4. only modifyable ---> setter method
    5. Both readable and modifyable ---> both getter and setter.
    4. Neither readable nor modify ---> neither getter and setter...

 # Relationship ----> 
   - Java is Object oriented programing language , in which we represent real world entity in the form of object.
   - Relationship is nothing connection between two object by using it two or more object communicate with each other.
   - In java we have two types of relationship 
     1. has-a relationship
     2. is-a relationship
     
   # has-a relationship --- > Strong bonding
   - It is relationship between two object in which one object depending on the another object.
   - It is relationship between a whole object and a part of it.
   - example : Mobile has a battery.
   - Human has brain.
   - Human has heart.
   - Laptop has a charger.
   - Car has a Engine.
   - Phone has a simCard.
   - wrt has a relationship we have two type of object.
   - Depending object: In has a relationship the object who is depending on the another object is known as depending object.
   - Dependent Object: The object on which another object depends is known as dependent object.. 
   - Ex : Battery , Remote , Engine , SimCard , Brain.
 # How to represent has-a relationship
  - ---------HAS-A------------
  - Mobile <--------- Battery
# How to achieve has-a relationship
 - To achieve has-a relationship first we need to create dependent class and then  depending on class & we need to create 
   an instance of dependent class inside the depending on  class , In such a way during the loading process of depending 
   object , dependent object should be loaded first.
# Types of Has-a relationship / Association
1. composition : tightly coupled
   - In this relationship one object is completely dependent on another object , without one object another object cannot
      survive.
   - Car and engine.
   - Human and heart.
2. Aggregation : 
  - In this one object will depend on the another , but without one object second can still survive.
  - In this case dependent object will be created when it requires.

   Ques : Create class  Car and create one more class wheel and establish has a relationship between them.

# IS-A Relationship
  - It is a relationship between two object in which one object acquires the properties and behaviour from another object .
  - Example : Car is a Vehicle.
  - Java is a programing language.
  - Doctor is a person.
  - Airtel is a sim-Card.
  - Marker is a Pen.
  - Toyota is a Company. 
  - wrt to is a relationship there are two types of object.
    1. Parent object : Ann object which provides its properties and behaviour to the another object is known as parent object.
       it is also known as Base object or super object.
    2. Child object : An object which acquires its properties and behaviour from another object is called Child object,
       it is also known as sub and derived object.
    3.  This relationship is similar as a relationship between parent and child.
    4.  Is-A relationship emphasize on code reusability.
    5.  It is a unidirectional relationship.
    6.  It is used to achieve generalization.
  
# Inheritance :  
  - It is one of the principle of object-oriented programing which is used to achieve is-A relationship.
  - wrt to inheritance there are two types of class.
  1. parent class : A class which provides its properties an d behaviour to the another class . it is also known as
       super class or base class. 
  2. Child Class : A class which acquires properties and behaviour from the another class is known as child class , it is also 
     known as sub class or derived class.
  3. it is represented with the help of solid arrow , head of the arrow will points towards parent class and tails points the 
   child class.
  4. In java we can achieve inheritance with the help of extends keyword.

           class ParentClassName{
          }
          class childClassName extends ParentClassName{}

          class Car {}
  
          class HondaCity extends Car{}
5.  Inheritance wrt to static member:
    - static member of static class will get inherited to the child class. It means static variable and method both will be inherited.
    - how static we can  achieve inheritance wrt to static...
    - When we execute child class it(JVM) starts loading process child class members but before loading it will check is there any parent of 
       this(Child) class & it is already loaded or not , if it is not loaded JVM will first load parent class and then child class.
    - Class Static area of child class will have a built-in reference of class static area of parent class.
    
6. Inheritance wrt to non-static member
   - Non-static member of parent class will be Inherited to the child class .
   - whenever we create a object of child class then non-static member of child class will be loaded inside the object,
     before it non-static member of parent class will be loaded , that's how inheritance wrt non-static member is achieved.
   - We can call constructor of parent class with the help of constructor of child class with the help of super() call
     .
   - Super() call statement
   - It is used to call the constructor of parent class from the constructor of child class.
   - It means it is used to achieve the constructor chaining in different class
   - It is only used inside the constructor.
   - It must be the first statement inside the constructor body.
   - We cannot have more than one super() call statement inside the same constructor.
   - We cannot use this() and super() call statement inside the same constructor.
   - If we have n constructor we can have maximum n super() call statement.
   - If inside a constructor there is no this call statement then compiler will a non-argument super() call statement
   
7. when we create an object of child class ,inside the child class constructor first statement is super() call statement
   it will call the constructor of parent class .parent class constructor will load the non-static member of parent class
   inside the object of child class after that child class constructor is load non-static member of child class inside the object 
  , thus inside the object of child class we non-static member of parent class as well as child class , and that's how inheritance 
    wrt to non-static member is achieved.

 Ques : Create a java program to invoke all the constructor of parent class from child class.

# Super
  - It is a keyword.
  - It is used to access no-static member of parent class form the child class
  - It is used to access the member of parent class inside the child class.
  - It can be only used inside the non-static context.

# Non-primitive TypeCasting
 - The process of converting one type of non-primitive data into another type of non-primitive data,is known as non-primitive typeCasting:
 - it has two type: 
   1. UpCasting : 
    
      - The process of converting child type of reference into parent type of reference is known as up-casting.
      - It is done by the compiler implicitly.
      - As a programmer we don't need to explicitly convert it.
      - Advantages of upcasting
        - it is used to achieve generalization. parent type of reference variable will act as a generalization container
          in which we can store any of the child class object.
        - It is used to achieve loose coupling.
        - loose coupling : In object-oriented programing coupling refers association between two object.
        - Loose coupling refers/means independency between two object , if we crete a reference variable of parent type,
          then its not mandatory , we have to store specific child object inside it , we can store any of the
           child class object.
        - 
   2. Downcasting
   - The process of converting parent type of refrerence into child type is known as down-casting.
   - It is done by the compiler implicitly we have to do iot explicitly with the help of type-cast operator
   - Down-casting is used to overcome the drawback of up-casting...
   - Disadvantages of Upcasting
     - In Upcasted scenario with the help of parent class reference we cannot access the child class member...
  3. Class cast exception
    - it occurs during runtime.
    - it occurs when we try to 
      but parent doiesnit any instance of child.
     - if without upscting we try to downacsting we get classCastException ....

  4. instanceof 
    - it is a keyword .
    - It is a binary operator.
    - It is usded to checkk whether a reference having an instance of particuklar class or not,
    - Its return type is boolean.
    - We can avoid class cast exception by using it.    
    - Syantax : ref.var instanceof className;
# Types of Inheritance
1. Single level Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Multiple inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance.
5. Hybrid Inheritance.

# Single leval inheritance...
  - An inheritance which contains only one level is known as single level inheritance.
  - Example : pen and Digital pen , Room and classRoom , vehicle and Car

           vehicle <----(Extends)----- car
           Person <--------(Extends)----Programmer
              

# Multilevel Inheritance
  - An inheritance which contains more than one level is known as Multilevel Inheritance.
  - Animal <---(extends)---- PetAnimal <-----(extends)----- Dog <----(extends)--- Bull Dog


# Multiple Inheritance 

  - An inheritance in which one child is having more than one parent at a same level , is known as multiple inheritance.
  - bowler(parent) batsman(parent)and allrounder(child)
  - OPPO(parent) VIVO(parent) and OnePlus(Child);
  - Why java does not multiple inheritance wrt class...
    1. java does not support multiple inheritance wrt class , beacuse its leads to us diamond probleum.
    Diamond problem : if one class is having multiple parent at the same level and we crete an objet of child class inside a constructor of child class first statement will be super call statement. Here compliler which get confused which class constructor should i call, it is creating here an ambiguity probleum.

    If both the parent class is haviong methid with same signature we invoke it from the child class then again comopiler will get consfused. which method should i call , which again creates an ambuiguity problem... that's  calles diamond problem.

# Hierarchical Inheritance
  - An inheritance in which one parent is more than one child is known as hierarchical Inheritance.
  - Animal <--- Dog 

 # Hybrid Inheritance 
   - An inheritance which is the combination of more than one inheritamnce is known as hybrid Inheritance.
   Indoor game outdoor game cricket , football , badminton...

# POLYMORPHISM ------>
  - It is an abilioty iof an entity to show multiplwe forms 
  - Example : A peron is showing diffeernt differnt forms as a tuident , prefessional programmer , Developer , son and daughter .
  - Derived from two words
     poly ----> means many 
     morphs --- > many
  - In java we can acghiuve polymorphism in two ways compile time , run time ...

# Compile time polymorphism...
  - In compile time polymorphism which implemention of a member/method is excuted is decided by   
  2. Constructor Overloading.
  - In method overloading compiler will decide which method will be executed based on the type of formal and actual argument..

# shadowing
  1. shadowing : if both parent class and child class is having the member of same name then the presence of childs calss will act as a shadow , it means it will hide the parent class member , but oarenmt class member is vittually present inside the child class.
   

      Example : class A {
        static int i = 10;
      }
      class B extends A {
        static int i = 20; // Do comment Uncomment.

        psvm{

          sopln(i) // 20;
          sopln(A.i) // 10

        }
      }
  1. Variable Shadowing : if both parent class and subcalss is having variable with same name wheteher it is static or non-static is known as variable shadowing. In variable shadowing which variable will be executed depends upon place of usage , type of reference variable create.

  2. Method shadoeing : if both superclass and subclass having a method with same signature is known as Method shadowing.
    - There must be is-A relatioship between the class , means 
    - Both parent class and child class should have the same method signature.
    - Method should be static.
    - Both parent class and child class should have same return type. 
    - Child class method should have equal and higher visibilty.
    - Order of visibility
      private < Default < protected < public
