## history of java 
java was introduce in the year of 1991 by james gosling.
He along eith his team was woprking iun the compamny names sunmicrosystem. He faced some isiiur like 
security
plateform architecture etc.
**currently oralce is the owner of java.
**Java was developed mainly to build internet best/based application.
**java has two parent
1. C - from c it has taken syntax excluding pointers.
2.  C++ - from c++ OPPS concept.

## Programming language
- programming language is used to interact with the machine,
- A language whiuch is used to write the program is called a programming language
- Based on human understanding it is classified in three types:
1. High level language : A language which is completely understandable by human but not by machine is called 
  high level language  - java , c++ , c , python..
2. Mid?Intermediate level : A language which nethier completely understandable by human nor by machine 
  is called as mid level language - Bytecode
3. Low level/Binary/Machine level language : A language which is not understyandable by human 
   but completely understandable by machine 
  ex: 0's and 1's


## compiler 
It a software Which is used to convert high level language into low level language..

## Features of java
1. It is simple as compare to c
2. It is plateform Independent
3. It is secure
4. It has high performance
5. It is a efficient language
6. It supports OPPS
7. It supports multithreding(Multitasking)
8. It is portable
9. It is Robus (Widely Used)
10.   It has a large community support
11. It is strictly typed language 
12. It is case sensative
13. It is architectural neutral language
14. It is secure
15. Highly performance
16. Good memory management because of garbage collector

## Ques : Why java is platform independent language ?

## sourceCode ----> Compiler(JavaC)---->ByteCode(platformIndependent) -----> JVM(pleteformDependent) ----> 1.Windows 2.Mac 3.Linux 

1. java is a two step compilation based language itmeans compiler and interpreter both will work.
2. First compiler will works and convert java source code into ByteCode(mid level code).
3. After that JVM will take this bytecode as an input and convert it into the machine code.
4. It means it doent matter from which platform we are getting the byteCode we will get the same output on all the plateform..
5. This is the reason why java is plateform dependent language.

## Why java is secure ?
1. Because it do not support pointer thats why we cannot get actual location of memory . so we cannot get the access the actual 
address of a memory variable.
2. jvm is responsible to convert bytecode into machine code
3. Before executing the bytecode it will check 
 - whether the bytecode is geberated by the valid compiler or not
 - whether the bytecode is properly structured or not 
 - Whether the bytecode is properly structured or not 
 - if it find any problem it stops executing the bytecode.

## Why java is high performance ?
 - JVM executes the bytecode line by line 
 - suppose we invoke a function multiple times then - inside jvm we have a component known as JIT compiler will
   directly executes the bytecode into machine code.
