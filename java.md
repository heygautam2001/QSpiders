## history of java 
java was introduced in the year of 1991 by james gosling.
He along with his team was working in the company names sun-microsystem. He faced some issue like 
security
platform architecture etc.
**currently oracle is the owner of java.
**Java was developed mainly to build internet best/based application.
**java has two parent
1. C - from c it has taken syntax excluding pointers.
2.  C++ - from c++ OPPS concept.

## Programming language
- programming language is used to interact with the machine,
- A language which is used to write the program is called a programming language
- Based on human understanding it is classified in three types:
1. High level language : A language which is completely understandable by human but not by machine is called 
  high level language  - java , c++ , c , python.
2. Mid?Intermediate level : A language which neither completely understandable by human nor by machine 
  is called as mid level language - Bytecode
3. Low level/Binary/Machine level language : A language which is not understandable by human 
   but completely understandable by machine 
  ex: 0's and 1's


## compiler 
It a software Which is used to convert high level language into low level language.

## Features of java
1. It is simple as compare to c
2. It is platform Independent
3. It is secure
4. It has high performance
5. It is an efficient language
6. It supports OPPS
7. It supports multithreading(Multitasking)
8. It is portable
9. It is Robust (Widely Used)
10.   It has a large community support
11. It is strictly typed language 
12. It is case-sensitive
13. It is architectural neutral language
14. It is secure
15. Highly performance
16. Good memory management because of garbage collector

## Ques : Why java is platform independent language ?

## sourceCode ----> Compiler(JavaC)---->ByteCode(platformIndependent) -----> JVM(pleteformDependent) ----> 1.Windows 2.Mac 3.Linux 

1. java is a two-step compilation based language it means compiler and interpreter both will work.
2. First compiler will work and convert java source code into ByteCode(mid level code).
3. After that JVM will take this bytecode as an input and convert it into the machine code.
4. It means it doent matter from which platform we are getting the byteCode we will get the same output on all the plateform.
5. This is the reason why java is plateform dependent language.

## Why java is secure ?
1. Because it does not support pointer that is  why we cannot get actual location of memory . so we cannot get the access the actual 
address of a memory variable.
2. jvm is responsible to convert bytecode into machine code
3. Before executing the bytecode it will check 
 - whether the bytecode is generated by the valid compiler or not
 - whether the bytecode is properly structured or not 
 - Whether the bytecode is properly structured or not 
 - if it finds any problem it stops executing the bytecode.

## Why java is high performance ?
 - JVM executes the bytecode line by line 
 - suppose we invoke a function multiple times then - inside jvm we have a component known as JIT compiler will
   directly execute the bytecode into machine code.

## Java source file
- A file which contains instructions of java language is known as java source file.
- its extention will be .java

  ______________
## JDK - Java Development Kit 
- It contains all the necessary tools to develop a java program
-  Hierarchy of JDK
- JDK -----> JRE ------> JVM 
- JRE (JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT)
  1. It provides a run time environment to execute a java program

- JVM 
  1. JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE 
  2. It is an interpreter which is resposible for execute a java program 

- 3 steps to execute a java program
  1. Create a source file - create source file by using normal text editor notepad , 
  2. We can also use advance code editor vsCode , eclipse , intelligIdea.
  3. To create a source file we just need to create a file by any one the editor and save it by .java extention.
  4. Compile the source file - we need to compile the source file after the successfuly compilation ,
     compiler will generate bytecode file with name .class file 
  5. During the compilation the compiler will check rules and regulation (Syntax and semantics ).
  6. If compiler finds any mistake or error the compiler will throw an error and compiler will not generate .class
     file
  7. Syntax for the compilation
     1. javac source-file Name.java
     2. Ex : javac name.java
  8. Execution the .class file - In this stage we need to give .class file as an input to the
     JVM will execute this and give us output.
  9. syntax for the execution:-
     1. java className
     2. javaSourceFile -----> compilation ---> .classFile ------> JVM -----> output

## # Basic structure of java program.
- First we need to create a file and save it with .java extension
  inside the file we can write our java instruction
- Inside a file we can create a class
  1. class - it is a predefined word 
  2. it must be written in the lowercase 
  3. it is used to create a class block
  4. class Demo {  Class-Block }
  5. file name and class name can be different ... It is not necessary to have same name class and file  
  6. Inside the class we can have the following components
     1. method
     2. variable
     3. constructor 
     4. static Initializer
     5. non static Initializer
     6. class

## Tokens 
   1. This is the smallest component of any programming language which helps to write a program.
   2. In , java we have follow tokens.
      - keyword
      - identifier 
      - literals
      - separator
      - comments
      - operators
      - 
   3. Keyword
      - it is a predefined word 
      - it has special meaning / own meaning all the keyword written in the lowercase.
      - In , java we have 50+ keyword ---> Exactly 53
      
   4. Identifiers
      - It is the name given to recognize class in java
      - we cannot give any name we have to follow sum rules.
      - Rules of identifiers
        1. Cannot be started with number.
        2. Only '$' and '_' are used as a special character apart from these no special character can be used in an identifier.
        3. Spaces is not allowed in an identifier .
        4. Keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
   
      - Conventions
        1. it is not a rule of an identifier itr is just an industrial standard, which we should follow while 
           giving to the identifiers.
        2. Class Convention.
           1. class should be written in upper Camel-case.
           2. Every word first letter should be written in UpperCase
           3. convention for interface is the same.
        3. Method Convention 
           1. lower camel case.
           2. it means if it contains only one word it should be written 
              in the lowercase  , but if it contains multiple word from the second word onwards first word of each letter
              should be written in smallCase.
           3. Same convention for variables is followed.
      
   5. Literals
       1. it is a data pass by a programmer in a program.
       2. In java there have 4 types of literals
          1. Number ---> Types ----> Integer , Floating point
          2. Character 
          3. Boolean 
          4. String
          5. Number Literals:
             1. it can be of two types 
             2. 1. Integer 2. floating point
          6. Character Literals
             1. Anything which is enclosed within single quote and its length is exactly 1 is known as 
                character literals.
          7. Boolean Literals 
             1. it represents a logical data or a condition.
             2. it has two types 1. true 2. false
             3. true and false is a keyword 
          8. String literals 
             1. Anything which is passed within double quote is known as String literals
          9. separators 
             1. it is used to separate one component to another.
             2. , , ; , { } , : , () , . , 
          
          10. Comments
              1. its is the non-executable code which is used to increase the readabilty of the code.
              2. Types - Single Line , Multiline Comment
              3. Example : // This code is not readable as it is a comment and not going to execute.
              4. Example: /* 
                 This is a 
                 multi line comment
                */
          
          11. Operators
          

## Display Statement

 1. The statement which is used to print a message on the console . In java we have two types of display statement.
     i. System.out.println();
     ii.System.out.print();
     iii. System.out.printf();
2. System.out.println() : it is used to print a message on console. After that cursor will go on next line.
    1. example : System.out.println("hello");
       console is nothing just a collection of grid.
    2. it can be used without passing any data.
3. System.out.print()
   1. it is used to print the message on console after printing the cursor will go to the next position.
   2. it cannot be used without any data.


## variable
 1. It is a block of memory(Container) which is used to store a data.
 2. Every variable has some name so we can also call it as named block of memory.
    3. Declaration of memory....
       syntax : datatype identifier;
       Datatype: it specifies which type of data needs to be stored inside a block of memory.
    4. In java we have following datatype
       1. Primitive datatype
          1. It is a predefined datatype which is used to store primitive value/data
          2. In java we have follow  data type.
             1. byte ---> Integer--->1byte--->0
             2. short ----> Integer----> 2byte---->0
             3. long ----> Integer -----> 8byte---->0l/L
             4. int ----> Integer -----> 4byte----> 0
             5. float ----> float ----> 4byte ---- 0.0f
             6. char -----> character -----> 2byte ---> 'u\0000' 
             7. boolean ----> boolean ----> 1 bit ----> false;
             8. double -----> double -----> 8byte ----> 0.0
          3. Since these are predefined data type so it should be in the lowercase.
          4. after the decimal point if you want to store 5-6 no. you can use float but if you want to more decimal no 
              after point you can use double.
          
       2. Non-primitive data type
                           
      



## charateristics of variable
   1. it is temporary 
   2. it has a lifespan
   3. inside a variable you can add a single value , inside a variable you can store fetch and update a data.
   4. Initialize a variable
      byte b; declaration.
      b = 25; initialize.
            or
      byte b = 34;
## how declare multiple variable of same datatype.
   1. syntax: 
      - Datatypes identifier1 , identifier2 , identifier3 ....... identifier-n;
      - ex : int a ;
      - int b;
      - int c;
      int a , b , c;
      - byte n1;
      - double n2; 
      - float n3;
        byte n1 , double n2 , float n3; X XXX  not allowed error;
      - syntax :
          datatype identifier1 = value , identifier2 = value, identifier3 = value
   ## types of variable.
   1. Based on datatype
      - primitive variable
      - Non-primitive variable
   2. based on scope
      - Global variable i. static ii. non-static
      - Local variable
   # primitive datatype : 
   - A variable which is used to store primitive variable. primitive variable has fixed size.
   - ex : int a = 2 , byte b = 23 , float f = 2.6 ,  double a = 123.56845 

   # Non primitive varible 
   - it is used to store multi-value data
   - it is a user defined - it is created with the help of non-primitive data type.
   - Ex : Array , String , Object - syntax -> String s = null;

   # Based on scope: 
   - Global scope
   - Local Scope
   - Here scope means visibility of the variable
   - Local variable
     - A variable which is declared inside the method block or any other specific block.
     - class demo{
     - public static void main(String[] args){
     - char a = 'e'; //local variable
     - }
     - }
     - Rules of local variable:
     - we cannot use it outside the block because local variable is visible only within 
       the block where it is declared.
     - We cannot use it without initialization.
     - We cannot have more than one local variable with the same name within the same block.
   
   # operators 
   - It is a predefined symbol which is used to perform specific task.
   - Operand : Operand is the data on which operator works.
   - ex 10 + 20 operand - 10 and 20 + is operator
   - combination of operator and operand ex: 10 + 20 , 1*2 + 5  6;
   - characteristics of operator
   - Every operator after performing a task will return a data or value.
   - Every operator has some precedence or priority.
   - every operator follows rules of associativity. it means direction of execution . It means when two or more operator having
     the same precedence either from left to right or right to left.
   - Associativity has always not the same 
   - Note : In an expression of we have multiple operator then first it is evaluated based on the precedence of operator
     but two or more operator having same precedence then we have to solve according to associativity.
   - Types of operator
   - Based on operand
     - Unary
     - Binary
     - Ternary
   - Based on task
     - Arithmetic
     - increment/Decrement
     - Relational
     - Assignment
       - compound assignment
     - Logical operator
     - conditional operator
     - Bitwise operator
   
   - Based on the operand operator is classified into three types.
     unary : an operator which takes only one operand to perform a task is called unary operator
     ex: increment , decrement and logical not operator.
   - Binary operator : An operator which takes only two operand to perform a task is called unary operator.
     ex : Arithmetic relational operator , Assignment and relational.
   - Ternary : An operator which takes exactly operand to perform a task is called ternary operator.
      ex : conditional operator .
   - Based on the task:
     - Arithmetic operator : it is a binary operator which is used to perform an arithmetic operation
       ex : Addition(+) , subtraction(-) , multiplication(*) , division(/) , modulus(%)
       - it is used to add two numeric value - Integer and decimal - In addition operator in any one of operand 
       - of string type then instead of addition it will perform concatenation.
     
   - Modulus operator : it is used to divide a number and return a number.

## increment decrement operator : 
 - it is a unary operator 
 - it is used to increase and decrease a value by one.
 - based on the position it is classified into two types.
 - Increament --> preIncrement , PostIncrement
 - Decrement ---> postDecrement , preDecrement;
 - PostIncrement
   - it is a unary operator which is used to increase a value by one
   - it is written after the variable --> int n = 2; n++;
   - it will first used the existing value of the variable after that it increases the value.
 -PreIncrement
   - it is also a unary operator
   - which is used to increase a value by one but in preIncrement increment symbol is used before tha variable.
   - int i = 10; ---> sopln(++i);
   - it will first increase the value of a variable by one then used the updated value..
   - Note : Increment and decrement operator cannot be used on a constant value , it can be applied on a variable
   
## Assignment operator
   - it is binary operator , it is used to assign the value to the variable.Associativity : right to left.
   - LHS mus be a variable.
   - it has the least precedence.
   - Note : if an expression contains multiple operators then it will be solved based on the operators precedence, but if 
     two or more operator having same precedence then associativity of the operator will be followed.

## Compound Assignment operator 
   Combination of arithmetic operator and assignment operator.
   n+=2 ; n = n+2

## logical operator
   - logical AND (&&)
   - logical OR(||)
     - It is binary operator
     - It is used to merge more than one condition AND if any of the condition returns true it will also return true.
     - In logical or operator if the first condition returns true it will directly return true.It will not even check 
       the second condition.
   - logical NOT(!)
   - It can be used only on the condition of boolean data, In java we have above logical operator
   - write a condition to check whether a given day is comes under weekend or not

- write A condition to check whether given month is february or not based on no of days
- int noOfDays = 28;
- if(noOfDays == 28 || noOfDays == 29)
- sout(True)
- Write a program to check whether a number is multiple of 5 or 6       
- logical or operator is used whenever we have multiple conditions & we have to satisfy anyone of them.
- conditions should return true.
- if all the conditions returns false then only logical ir operator returns false.


## logical AND OPERATOR (&&)
   - It is a binary operator 
   - It is used when we have to satisfy all the conditions
   - If any one of the condition return it directly return false , it will not check the further conditions.
   - Ques : Write a condition to check whether a given number is positive even number or not. 
   - It returns true when all the conditions is satisfied (true)
   - Write a conditions to check whether a given character is lowercase alphabet or not.
   - Write a program whether a given number is align within 100 or multiple of 5.
   - Write a java program to check whether a year is leap year or not.

## Logical Not
   - It is unary operator
   - It is used to negate a condition or reverse a given condition . its return type is always be boolean.
   - It can be used only on the condition or boolean literals.
   - ex: sout(!true)----> false.
         sout(!false)----> true.
## Ternary Operator || conditional operator
   - it is a ternary operator .
   - it is used to take a decision.
   - it acts as a decision making statement.
   - syntax : operand1 ? operand2 : operand3.
   - operand1---> true ---> operand2 is ans.
   - operand1---> false ---> operand3 is ans.
   - operand1 should be a condition

```
# working of ternary operator 
 - In operand1 we have to write a condition which evaluates to true and false.
 - In place of operand2 and operand3 , you can write any data , number , string, values.
 - The return type of conditionals / ternary operator depends upon the data type of operand2 and operand3.
 - Ques : write a java to find smallest of two number;

        int a = 23;
        int b = 12;
        a >= b ? System.out.println("a is greater") : System.out.println("b is greater");
 -  write a java program to check whether a given number is even or odd.
        
        int a = 5;
        a%2 == 0 ? System.out.println("even number") : System.out.println("odd number");
 - write a java program to check whether a given character is number or not.
       
       char ch = '10';
- when you want to take last digit of any number then we have to take its modulus by 10.

# TYPE CASTING
  - The process of cionverting one type of data into another type of  data is known as typecasting.
  - We have two types ---> primitive typecasting ----> Non-primitive.
      primitive ---> 1. widening 2. narrowing 
  -   Non primitive ----> 1.upcasting 2. down-casting 
  - Primitive typecasting
     - The process of converting one type of primitive data into another type primitive data is known as 
       primitive typecasting.
     - Widening : The process of converting smaller type of data into larger type of data is known as widening.
       - Ex : byte b = 10; int a = b;
       - float f = 3.6f;
         double d = f;
       - char ch = 'y';
         long l = ch;
       - it is done by the compiler implicitly because here there no chance of data loss.
       - byte < short < int < long < float < double -----> widening.
       - ASCII
       - It stands for 'american standard code for information interchange'. It means for every character 
          unique positive number is associative or linked with the character.
       - It will be up to 256 character.
     - Narrowing :
       - The process of converting larger type of data into smaller type of data .
       - In case of narrowing there is a chance of data loss , so we have to do typecasting externally.
     
     - Recycling process : The process converting the in the range of datatype:

# #if
  - It is a keyword
  - syntax
  -          if(conditions){
                //java statement///
             }
  - if condition is true then the block of code executed.
  - if condition is false then the block of  is skipped
  - simple if is used to take the decision when we want to execute or skip a set of instruction based on the conditions.
  - working process.
    - In the 'if' first controller will check the condition if the condition is returns true then it will go 
      inside the block and execute all the set of instruction.
    - Ques : write a program to check whether a given number is multiple of five or not if it is multiple then 
      print its square.
    - Ques : Write a program to print the number if it contains fraction value otherwise skip it.
    - Ques : Write a program to check whether a number 0 or not at the unit place ;
## if else:
   - Both if and else are keyword
   - syntax :

                if(conditions){

                    //Code java
                 }
                else{

                  //java code

                  }
   - if we have to take tye decision whether one set statement will be executed or another set 
     of statement will be executed then we use if else statement.
   - # #working process
       1. First control will the check the if condition , if it returns true then if block will get executed but if it 
           returns false then else block will get executed.
       2. In if else any one block  will get executed , both the block are never get executed once.
       3. write a java program to check whether a character is alphabet or not.
       4.  write to java program check whether a number is even or odd .
       5. write a java program to check whether a given number multiple of 8 or not if it is multiple then check 
        it is also multiple of 3 and 6 both or not.
   # else if ladder.
   - it is used whenever we have more than two options and we have to select only one options.
   - syntax : 
        
          if(condition){
               java code      
          }
          else if(conditions){
                java code       
   
           }
          else if(conditions){
                java code

           }
    
          else if(conditions){
                 java code

           }
         .
         .
         .
         else{
          
           java code..

         }
   - In else if ladder first control will check the if condition , if the condition is satisfied then it will go 
     inside the if block and executes all the statement , but if it returns false then it will check the next else if
     condition , if any else if condition returns true then that corresponding block will get executed & it will
     not check any else if condition further , but if all the else if condition returns false then it will execute else block.
   -  In else if ladder else block is not mandatory , it is optional.
   - Ques : Write a program to determine student grades based on the obtained marks.
   - Ques : write a java program to check whether a given character is , number , alphabet or special character.
   - Ques: Write a java program to find smallest of three number;

# switch conditional keyword
 - it is a keyword
 - syntax:
   
       switch(value/exp)
       {
         case val/exp : //java ststement
         case val/exp: //java statement
         case val/exp: //java statement
         .
         .
         .
         .
         default : //java statement
        }
 - inside switch we can pass byte , short , int , char and string typeof value, but we cannot pass float , double , long
   and boolean type of value
 - int the case we have to pass constant value , it means we cannot pass a variable also.
 - # working process of switch:
 - switch uses predefined equality operator which compares value of switch with the value of case, if any case value
   is getting matched with the switch value then that particular case block along with all the remaining below
    case block will also gets executed without checking the case value.
 - if no case value is matching with the switch value then default block will get executed.



# 22-05-2025 Methods In Java
- It is a block of code or set instructions which is used to perform a specific task.
- if we want to perform a specific task  in our requirement then instead of writing a the related code in every
  requirement , we will write irt ones and reuse it every requirement.
- advantages of methods
  - It enhances code reusability.
  - It also increases code reusability.
- characteristics of methods.
  - Method will get executed whenever it is called.
  - we can have n number of method inside a class.
  - we can use/call the methods n numbers of time.
  - Method are executed in stack area , called stack frame.
- Syntax to create a methods.
    
      [Modifiers] return-type methodName([formal argument])
       {
           
          //code.
      
        }
        public static void main(String []args){
        }
- Method terminology
  1. method signature -> method name + formal Argument is termed as method signature.
  2. main(String[] args)
  3. Method Declaration -> Modifier , return type along with method signature
  4. public static void main(String []args)
  5. Methods definition
  6. Method declaration + Method body
  7. public static void main(String []args)
     {

     }
- Modifiers...
  - It is used to change or modified the behaviour of component of java.
  - In Java we have two types of modifiers
    1. Access Modifiers ---> public , private , protected , default...
    2. Non-Access Modifiers ,---> static , volatile , abstract , final , native , synchronized. 
- Return type - when a method is called it will perform a task and return a data to thr caller.
  return type specifies which type of data is given back to the caller.
  1. void -> does not return anything.
  2. primitive type
  3. non-primitive.
